
Files are RFC-4180-compliant CSV files with a single row of column names.

The names reflect how the defect is represented.
 'multiply': the resistance of bonds involving the site is increased
 'remove': the site and all connected edges are removed

MIND YOUR STEP!!:
 * R0 (the unit of resistance) is the initial resistance of a SINGLE BOND!

 * The middle column is intended to be an alternate x-axis.

 * NOT ALL FILES USE THE SAME X DATA!!!
   The 'remove' data is provided at a higher resolution.
   The 'multiply-5' data ran for longer.

 * The 'remove' data uses 'inf' to represent infinite resistance.
